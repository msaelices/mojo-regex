## Goal

Fix the performance regression in complex_number_extraction by enabling SIMD optimization for the pattern [0-9]+[.]?[0-9]* without breaking correctness.

Implementation Strategy - Phase 1: State-Aware SIMD

1. Modify _try_match_simd() to Handle Complex Patterns

- Add pattern structure analysis to detect [0-9]+[.]?[0-9]* type patterns
- Implement segmented SIMD matching: digits → optional dot → optional digits
- Add quantifier validation to prevent greedy matching

2. Enable SIMD for Multi-Character Sequences

- Uncomment and fix the _try_enable_simd_for_sequence() call
- Improve the digit-heavy pattern detection logic
- Add validation constraints to ensure correctness

3. Create Hybrid Matching Logic

- Modify SIMD matching to respect DFA state constraints
- Implement progressive validation for each pattern segment
- Ensure quantifier limits are respected

4. Testing and Validation

- Run all tests to ensure no regressions
- Benchmark the performance improvement
- Validate that complex_number_extraction shows significant speedup

Expected Outcome

- Restore SIMD optimization for [0-9]+[.]?[0-9]* pattern
- Achieve performance comparable to simple [0-9]+ patterns
- Maintain 98%+ test pass rate
- Address the ~1.12x performance regression identified in benchmarks

This focused approach targets the immediate performance issue while laying groundwork for more comprehensive SIMD improvements in the future.
